**Story**

â€¢ The contents of this game are simple and profound. There were princes of both countries. The blue prince and the red prince. They were quite close when they were young, but the earthquake divided the two countries, so they forgot each other's faces for quite a long time, and they thought each other's country was ruined. Over time, the blue country connected the divided cliffs to the single-wood bridge, and the two countries, which had forgotten each other's existence, each sent their own princes to explore and fight, thinking that they were enemies.
As a two-player game, it is a game that pushes the enemy into a cliff first by putting a differentiated response to defense and attack.
The theme was applied to the referee and expressed as if the players were confused when moving actively.
Users of this game can move on both sides, including jumps, collect gages through defense and attack, and then use flashy attacks to drive enemies into limbs.
